This python code was written using a pre-existing people counter (Gupu25, 2019) and adapted to detect, track, and count bats emerging from a roost. This code was created as part of a MSc dissertation in Wildlife Biology and Conservation that aims to determine the detectability of different bat emergence count methods: naked eye count, Infrared video recording, thermal video recording, and a python code that auto counts the emerging bats from the thermal recordings. This code proved to be effective at identifying and counting emerging bats from thermal recorded footage as they dropped out of a roost and crossed a boundary line. This code failed to effectively count bats as they were returning to the roost. Major sources of error came from camera shake, multiple bats emerging at once on top of each other, and bats emerging in eratic directions that didn't cross the boundary line.
